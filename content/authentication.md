Termii authenticates your API requests using your accountâ€™s API key.
API calls are authenticated by including your secret key in the Authorization header of every request you make.
If you do not include your key when making an API request or use one that is invalid, Termii returns an http error.
To get your Termii API key <a href='https://accounts.termii.com/#/register' target="_blank">sign up</a> here.
