These docs will give you a deep dive into our full API Reference Documentation and how to seamlessly integrate our messaging channels and verification functionalities into your product.

## Basics
Our API is organised around using HTTP verbs and REST. Our API  accepts and returns JSON formatted payload.

We provide sample code snippets and API calls that can serve as guide during your integration process.

We also advice running some tests using Postman. Postman is a collaboration platform for API development which makes testing endpoints easy. We have also provided a Postman <a style="cursor:pointer; color:#406DAD" href="https://termii.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/upload/files/75963Z65FmbjqAohATnC.json" target="_blank">Collection</a> you can easily import to your postman and start testing.
