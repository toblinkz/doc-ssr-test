Termiiâ€™s Switch allows you to send messages to any country in the world across SMS and WhatsApp channel through a REST API. Every request made is identified by a unique ID that help our users track the status of their message either by receiving Delivery Reports (DLRs) over their set webhook endpoints or polling the status of the message using a specific endpoint.

The Switch is organised around using HTTP verbs and REST. Our API  accepts and returns JSON formatted payload.
